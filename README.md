## 📌 What is Boosting?

Boosting is an **ensemble technique** that:

- Builds a **strong classifier/regressor** by combining several **weak learners**
- Learns sequentially: each new model tries to correct errors from the previous one
- Uses the **same data repeatedly**, unlike bagging where each model sees different subsets

> 🔑 Boosting is based on **additive modelling**, not “wisdom of the crowd” like bagging.

## 🧠 Additive Modelling Explained

- Boosting relies on **adding multiple functions** (models):  
  `F(x) = f₀(x) + f₁(x) + f₂(x) + ... + fₙ(x)`
- Each function corrects the residuals from the previous.
- The process continues until the error is minimized or a stopping criterion is met.

## 🌲 Gradient Boosting – Step-by-Step

1. **Initialize Model 0**:
   - Predict the **mean of the target column** using squared loss.
   - `f₀(x) = mean(y)`

2. **Calculate Pseudo Residuals**:
   - `rᵢ = yᵢ - f₀(xᵢ)`
   - These residuals show how wrong the model is.

3. **Train Model 1 (shallow decision tree)** on pseudo residuals:
   - Use residuals as the new target column.
   - Resulting tree gives **terminal regions (leaf nodes)**.

4. **Calculate Output Values for Each Leaf Node**:
   - Compute a constant for each region to minimize loss.

5. **Update the Ensemble**:
   - `F₁(x) = f₀(x) + γ₁ h₁(x)`

6. **Repeat Steps 2–5** for N iterations:
   - Each new model fits on residuals of current ensemble.
   - Final model:  
     `Fₙ(x) = f₀(x) + Σ (γₘ * hₘ(x)) for m=1 to n`

## ✅ Why is Gradient Boosting so Effective?

- Handles **non-linear, complex patterns** in data.
- Performs well **even with minimal hyperparameter tuning**.
- Achieves **low bias and low variance** when tuned properly.

## ⚙️ Types of Models: HVLB vs LVHB vs LBLV

| Model Type | Description | Examples |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **HVLB**   | High Variance, Low Bias | Deep Trees, Bagging Trees |
| **LVHB**   | Low Variance, High Bias | Decision Stumps, Linear Models |
| **LBLV**   | Low Bias, Low Variance | Gradient Boosting (tuned), XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost |

> 🔹 In Boosting: use **LVHB** models (shallow trees).  
> 🔹 In Bagging: use **HVLB** models (deep trees).

## 🧩 Terminal Regions in Decision Trees

- **Terminal region = leaf node** in decision tree.
- Each boosting tree has:
  - `J` leaf nodes → `J` terminal regions
- For each region `Rⱼₘ`, we compute:
